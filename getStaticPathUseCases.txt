You should use getStaticPaths if you’re statically pre-rendering pages that use dynamic routes and:

The data comes from a headless CMS
The data comes from a database
The data comes from the filesystem
The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific)
The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — 
getStaticProps generates HTML and JSON files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance
